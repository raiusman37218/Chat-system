 * were reaching for the anonymous key, which row level security correctly
 * refuses for tables like `workspaces`. The failure was silent: the settings
 * query returned an empty array, `ai_settings` came back undefined, and the
 * assistant quietly behaved as though no model were configured. Adding a valid
 * API key changed nothing, because the code never saw it.
 *
 * The service role key is the supported way for trusted server code to read
 * past RLS. It must never reach the browser, so this module is server-only.
