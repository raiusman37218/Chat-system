# Zentry: guide for working in this repo

Zentry (also written "Zen-try"; older code, CSS classes and seed data say "Chatify") is a multi-workspace live chat support platform, similar to Intercom. It has five surfaces:

| Surface | Route / artifact | Who uses it |
|---|---|---|
| Marketing site + auth | `/`, `/login`, `/signup`, `/onboarding` | Prospects, new workspace owners |
| Agent inbox + workspace settings | `/dashboard` (a single client page with views: inbox, radar, reports, helpdesk, settings) | Agents, admins and owners of one workspace |
| Public help center | `/help/[workspaceId]/...`, served on `<slug>.$HELP_BASE_DOMAIN` or a verified custom domain via host rewriting in `src/middleware.ts` | End customers |
| Embeddable chat widget | `public/widget.js`, built from `widget/src/index.ts` | Visitors on customer websites |
| Platform-owner admin | `/admin`, `/admin/audit` | Platform super admins (`agents.is_super_admin`) |

The AI bot (auto-reply, suggested replies, summaries, sentiment, translation) runs in route handlers under `src/app/api/ai/*` and `src/lib/ai/*`.

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` maps each surface to its files, routes and tables in more detail. `docs/AUDIT.md` lists known bugs and security issues. **Read the workspace isolation section of the audit before you touch RLS, API routes or server actions.**

## Tech stack

- **Next.js 16.3 (App Router) + React 19.2 + TypeScript 5** (`strict: true`, path alias `@/*` → `src/*`). This Next.js version has breaking changes from older ones, so read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before using a Next API (see `AGENTS.md`). For example, `middleware.ts` is deprecated in 16 in favour of `proxy.ts`, but this repo still uses `src/middleware.ts`.
- **Supabase**: Postgres with Row Level Security, Auth (email/password, Google OAuth, custom 6-digit OTP signup), Realtime (`postgres_changes` on `messages`, `conversations`, `internal_notes`, `visitors`), and `pgvector` for semantic search. Clients come from `@supabase/ssr` and `@supabase/supabase-js`.
- **Tailwind CSS v4** (`@tailwindcss/postcss`). Design tokens are CSS variables (`--ds-*`) in `src/app/globals.css`, documented in `docs/DESIGN.md`. Dark mode is driven by `data-theme` on `<html>` through `@custom-variant dark`; there is no `.dark` class toggle.
- **UI libraries**: `lucide-react` icons, `recharts` charts, `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` via `cn()` in `src/lib/utils.ts`. There is no component library; shared primitives live in `src/components/ui/`.
- **AI**: a multi-provider layer in `src/lib/ai/provider.ts` (Anthropic via `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, plus OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek and OpenAI-compatible endpoints over `fetch`). Each workspace stores its own provider and key in `workspaces.ai_settings`. Retrieval is BM25 (`src/lib/ai/retrieval.ts`) plus pgvector hybrid search (`src/lib/ai/semantic-retrieval.ts`, RPC `fn_hybrid_search_chunks`).
- **Other services**: Cloudinary (attachments, `src/lib/cloudinary.ts`), Nodemailer SMTP (`src/lib/email/smtp.ts`; each workspace has its own SMTP, and the platform SMTP is stored in `platform_settings`), Resend (offline-agent emails), the Vercel SDK (custom-domain provisioning, `src/lib/vercel-domains.ts`), and Meta/WhatsApp/LinkedIn webhooks with an optional external LangGraph agent (`src/lib/agent/langgraph.ts`, `src/lib/channels/dispatcher.ts`).
- **Widget**: a separate package in `widget/` that is plain TypeScript in a Shadow DOM, bundled by esbuild into an IIFE at `public/widget.js`. It talks to Supabase directly with the anon key, and to this app's `/api/*` routes with CORS `*`.
- **Hosting**: Vercel. The repo has no `vercel.json`, so cron routes are not scheduled from here.

## Running locally

Prerequisites: Node 20+ and npm (the lockfile is `package-lock.json`).

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local        # then fill in real values, see below
npm run dev                        # http://localhost:3000  (.claude/launch.json uses the same)
```

Environment variables (the full list is in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §4):

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: required. Many files fall back to a hardcoded production project URL and anon key when these are missing. Set them explicitly so you don't hit production by accident.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: needed by `serviceClient()` (AI auto-reply, invites, signup OTP, crons). Without it these routes fall back to the anon key and silently do nothing.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `HELP_BASE_DOMAIN` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_HELP_BASE_DOMAIN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_HOSTS`: control routing and links. Host routing treats any non-platform host as a possible custom domain.
- Channels: `CHANNEL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (required to connect any channel), `META_APP_ID`, `META_APP_SECRET`, `META_WHATSAPP_CONFIG_ID`, `META_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` (embedded signup and the shared webhook), optional `META_GRAPH_API_VERSION`. Instagram: `INSTAGRAM_APP_ID`, `INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET`, `INSTAGRAM_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`, `INSTAGRAM_HUMAN_AGENT_ENABLED`, optional `INSTAGRAM_GRAPH_API_VERSION`.
- Optional: `CLOUDINARY_*`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `VERCEL_API_TOKEN`/`VERCEL_TOKEN` + `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` (+ `VERCEL_TEAM_ID`), `META_VERIFY_TOKEN`, `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, and AI keys (normally stored per workspace in `ai_settings`, not in env).
- Never commit env files. `.gitignore` covers `.env` and `.env*.local`, but `env.download` was committed with real secrets (see `docs/AUDIT.md`).

Widget:

```bash
cd widget && npm install
npm run build      # esbuild → ../public/widget.js (minified IIFE); commit the output
npm run watch      # rebuild on change while testing with /demo.html?workspaceId=<uuid>
```

Database: there is no `supabase/config.toml`, and the migrations are **not** a complete schema. Core tables (`workspaces`, `articles`, `workspace_integrations`, `platform_settings`, `email_verifications`), many columns (`workspace_id` on agents/visitors/conversations, `messages.is_internal`/`metadata`, `conversations.ai_mode`/`channel`/`tags`), and RPCs such as `fn_upsert_visitor`, `fn_visitor_heartbeat` and `fn_get_or_create_conversation` were created outside the repo. You cannot build a fresh local database from `supabase/migrations/` alone. New migrations are applied to the linked project with the Supabase CLI (`supabase db push`) or the SQL editor.

## Testing and checks

- `npm test` runs **Vitest** (`vitest.config.ts`, files matching `src/**/*.test.ts`). The current suites cover the AI bot: `src/lib/ai/intent.test.ts` (intent classification over a table of sample messages, including Roman Urdu and off-topic ones) and `src/lib/ai/bot-pipeline.test.ts` (the full answer pipeline against a fixture help center, with Supabase and the model mocked). Mock `@/lib/supabase/service` and `@/lib/ai/provider` in new tests; never call a real database or model from a test.
- `npm run test:db` runs the **database tests** (`src/**/*.db.test.ts`) against a throwaway local Postgres. `scripts/test-db.sh` boots a temporary cluster (needs Postgres 15+ binaries; nothing touches Supabase), loads a stub of Supabase's roles and `auth.uid()` (`supabase/tests/`), applies the real migrations, and runs the tests. Each test runs in a rolled-back transaction and acts as `anon`, a given agent, or `service_role` through the helpers in `src/test/db.ts`. `npm test` skips these suites when `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is unset. Put rules that live in SQL (triggers, RLS) under test here. If a new migration depends on an older one the script doesn't load, add it to the list in the script.
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: type-checks cleanly today; keep it that way.
- `npm run lint` (ESLint 9 + `eslint-config-next`) currently fails with ~530 errors, mostly `no-explicit-any`, plus `react-hooks/*` and the generated `public/widget.js`. Don't add new errors in files you touch. For a scoped run: `npx eslint src/path/to/file.tsx`.
- `npm run build`: the production build check.
- `verify_*.mjs` and `scratch/*.mjs` are manual smoke scripts run with `node <file>`. They use a **hardcoded production Supabase URL and keys**, and many of them create users and write rows. Do not run them unless you mean to touch production.
- To check a UI change, run `npm run dev`, sign up, finish onboarding, then open `/demo.html?workspaceId=<your workspace id>` in a second tab to talk to your own inbox.

## Database schema overview

All tenant data hangs off `workspaces.id`. Some child tables carry `workspace_id` directly; others are scoped through their parent row.

| Table | Purpose / key columns | Tenant key |
|---|---|---|
| `workspaces` | Tenant. Branding (`brand_color`, `logo_url`, greeting, widget placement), `slug` (help-center subdomain), `custom_domain*`, `business_hours`, `auto_assignment`, `ai_settings` (provider, model, **api_key**), `smtp_settings` (**password**), `navbar_trigger_config`, `help_center_*`, `industry`, plan/limits, `is_suspended`, `deleted_at`, `merged_into_workspace_id`, `owner_id` → auth.users | `id` |
| `public_workspaces` (view) | Non-secret projection of `workspaces` for anon reads (middleware routing, help center) | `id` |
| `agents` | One row per auth user (`id` = `auth.users.id`). `workspace_id` (an agent belongs to **one** workspace), `role` ∈ owner/admin/agent, `status` online/away/offline, `is_super_admin` | `workspace_id` |
| `visitors` | Widget/channel end users: name, email, page, geo, device, `ip_address`, `timezone`, `language`, `channel`, `channel_user_id` | `workspace_id` |
| `visitor_page_history` | Browsing trail | via `visitor_id` |
| `conversations` | `visitor_id`, `assigned_agent_id`, `status` open/closed/snoozed/pending, `priority`, `channel`, `ai_mode` autopilot/copilot/disabled, `tags[]`, `csat_rating`, `summary`, `sentiment`, `snoozed_until`, `merged_into`, `last_resolved_at`, `channel_metadata` | `workspace_id` |
| `messages` | `conversation_id`, `sender_type` visitor/agent/ai/system, `sender_id`, `content`, `attachment_url`, `is_internal`, `metadata` (translations, AI idempotency keys), `reply_to_message_id`, `delivered_at`, `read_at`, `email_notified_at` | via conversation |
| `internal_notes`, `conversation_tags` | Legacy per-conversation notes/tags (internal notes are now mostly `messages.is_internal`) | via conversation |
| `canned_responses` | Saved replies (`shortcut`, `title`, `content`; `agent_id` null = team-wide) | `workspace_id` |
| `tickets` | The unit of work: `number` (per workspace, from #1001), `subject`, `status` new/open/pending/on_hold/solved/closed, `priority`, `type` question/incident/problem/task, `assignee_id`, `group_id`, `tags[]`, `requester_id` (visitor), `channel` chat/email/web_form, `follow_up_of_id`, `merged_into_id`, solved/closed timestamps. `conversations.current_ticket_id` points at a conversation's current ticket; `messages.ticket_id` is the ticket thread | `workspace_id` |
| `ticket_events` | Audit log: actor (agent/customer/system/bot), action, field, old → new. Written only by triggers | `workspace_id` |
| `ticket_groups`, `ticket_group_members`, `ticket_views`, `ticket_counters` | Groups tickets route to (`round_robin`, `rr_last_agent_id`) and who is in each; saved inbox views (filters + sort, personal or shared); the per-workspace number counter | `workspace_id` |
| `ticket_presence` | Who is viewing/replying/noting on a ticket right now (heartbeat rows, ignored after 45 s) | `workspace_id` |
| `agents` (team columns) | `role` owner/admin/agent/light_agent, `status` online/away/offline, `is_active`/`deactivated_at`, `max_open_tickets` (capacity; null = no limit) | `workspace_id` |
| `help_sections`, `articles` | Help center collections and articles (`slug` unique per workspace, `status` published/draft, `order_index`, view/helpful counters) | `workspace_id` |
| `article_feedback`, `article_slug_redirects`, `article_chunks` | Votes, old-slug redirects, pgvector(768) chunks + FTS for RAG | `workspace_id` |
| `knowledge_notes` | Private team notes; `visibility` agent_only / assistant (assistant notes reach the bot via `fn_assistant_notes`) | `workspace_id` |
| `unanswered_questions` | Deduplicated questions the bot could not answer (with embedding) | `workspace_id` |
| `workspace_integrations` | Slack/Meta/WhatsApp/LinkedIn/LangGraph config and tokens | `workspace_id` |
| `super_admin_audit_logs`, `platform_settings`, `email_verifications` | Platform-level: admin audit trail, platform SMTP/branding, signup OTP codes | none |

Main RPCs:

- Called by the widget as anon (`SECURITY DEFINER`): `fn_get_workspace_config`, `fn_upsert_visitor`, `fn_update_visitor_meta`, `fn_visitor_heartbeat`, `fn_get_or_create_conversation`, `fn_get_visitor_conversations`, `fn_mark_messages_delivered`/`_read`, `fn_submit_article_feedback`, `fn_track_article_view`, `fn_record_unanswered_question(_semantic)`, `fn_assistant_notes`, `fn_hybrid_search_chunks`.
- Super-admin: `fn_get_platform_companies_summary`, `fn_get_platform_analytics`, `fn_get_company_analytics`, `fn_merge_workspaces`.
- RLS helpers: `fn_is_workspace_member`, `fn_is_workspace_admin`, `current_user_workspace_ids()`, `is_current_user_super_admin()`.

Triggers: `fn_auto_assign_conversation_on_create` (least-loaded online agent), `handle_new_message` (bumps `updated_at`, reopens on a visitor message, assigns on the first agent reply), `fn_conversation_resolution_bookkeeping`, and `fn_protect_agent_super_admin`.

**Isolation model:** RLS scopes authenticated users to `current_user_workspace_ids()` (and, for ticket tables, `fn_ticket_member()`). The widget runs as `anon`, and anon policies on `conversations`, `messages`, `visitors` and `agents` are still wide open (`docs/AUDIT.md` H-3). Ticket tables have no anon policy at all. Server code that uses `serviceClient()` bypasses RLS completely, so those call sites must check tenancy themselves. Agents cannot change their own `workspace_id` or role (a trigger guards it), so membership comes only from owning a workspace or an admin's invite.

**Ticketing rules live in the database** (`supabase/migrations/20261009110000_ticketing.sql`), so they hold for every writer: the widget, the bot, the old inbox and the ticket screens.
- New conversations get a ticket, and the first customer line becomes its subject.
- `new → open` when an agent replies publicly or the ticket is assigned.
- A customer reply reopens a pending or solved ticket.
- `fn_close_solved_tickets()` closes tickets that have been solved for 4 days. It is run daily by `/api/cron/close-solved-tickets`, which needs `CRON_SECRET`; the schedule is in `vercel.json`.
- Closed tickets are read-only. A new message on that conversation opens a linked follow-up ticket instead.
- Merging and search go through `fn_merge_tickets` and `fn_search_tickets`.
- Ticket status, priority, assignee and tags are kept in sync with the conversation's `status`/`priority`/`assigned_agent_id`/`tags`, so older code that writes conversations keeps working.
- Don't write ticket numbers, links or `ticket_events` from application code.

**Roles and teams live in the database too** (`supabase/migrations/20261010090000_teams_and_roles.sql`). One matrix, `fn_role_has(role, capability)`, decides everything; `src/lib/team/permissions.ts` mirrors it for the UI and `roles.db.test.ts` fails if they drift.
- `owner` / `admin`: everything (only the owner grants admin or manages admins; nobody changes their own role or deactivates themselves; the owner is never changed). `agent`: tickets, replies, notes, workspace content. `light_agent`: view and internal notes only, and can't be assigned tickets.
- Enforced by RLS plus triggers on `messages`, `conversations`, `tickets` and the content tables, so the old inbox (browser writes straight to Supabase), server actions and API routes all obey it. Triggers only check *direct* user statements (`fn_is_direct_user_write()`: signed-in, not service role, trigger depth ≤ 1); automatic writes (sync, bot, cron) are not the user's statement.
- A deactivated agent (`is_active = false`) has no role anywhere: `fn_workspace_role` returns NULL. Team changes go through `fn_set_member_role`, `fn_set_member_capacity`, `fn_deactivate_member` (reassign: one agent / group round-robin / unassign) and `fn_reactivate_member`; agents can't write those columns directly.
- A ticket in a group can only be assigned to a group member. Round-robin (`fn_next_round_robin_agent`) picks the next member who is **online** (away counts as unavailable), active, not a light agent, and under capacity (capacity counts New + Open tickets). Manual assignment may exceed capacity.
- Server code: call `getWorkspaceAccess(workspaceId, capability)` (`src/lib/team/access.ts`) in actions, and `guardConversation` / `guardWorkspace` / `guardMember` (`src/lib/team/route-guard.ts`) in API routes. Never add an agent-facing route without one.

---

## Coding conventions

Follow the patterns already in the code:

- **Formatting**: 2-space indent, single quotes, semicolons, trailing commas in multi-line literals. Components are `PascalCase.tsx` with a default or named export; lib modules are `kebab-case.ts`.
- **Imports**: always use `@/…` for `src/` (no deep relative paths). Types come from `@/types/database`. When you add a column, update the hand-written interface there.
- **Client vs server**: interactive components start with `'use client'`. Most pages, including `/dashboard`, are client components that query Supabase directly with `createClient()` from `@/lib/supabase/client`. Server Components and actions use `await createClient()` from `@/lib/supabase/server`.
- **Server Actions** (`src/app/actions/*.ts`, `'use server'`) are the default write path from the UI. Every action takes `workspaceId` as its first argument and must call a guard first: `assertAdminUser(workspaceId)` (admin.ts; admin/owner roles), `assertAgent(workspaceId)` (helpdesk.ts / knowledge.ts; any member), or `assertSuperAdmin()` (platform.ts). After the guard, use the cookie-session client so RLS applies, and **also** filter by `.eq('workspace_id', workspaceId)`. Actions either `throw new Error('Forbidden: …')` or return `{ success: false, error }`; match the file you're in. Super-admin mutations call `recordSuperAdminAudit`.
- **Route handlers** (`src/app/api/**/route.ts`) parse `await req.json()` inside `try/catch` and return `NextResponse.json({ error }, { status })`. Routes called by the widget export `OPTIONS` and add `CORS_HEADERS` (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) to every response.
- **Privileged access**: use `serviceClient()` from `@/lib/supabase/service` (server-only). Never import it into a client component, and never create a new `createClient(SUPABASE_URL, ANON_KEY)` in a route; the older routes that do are a known problem, not a pattern to copy. Any code that uses the service role must verify the caller and the conversation→workspace relationship itself.
- **Widget** (`widget/src/index.ts`): no framework. It builds DOM with template strings in a Shadow DOM. Run every dynamic value through `this.escapeHTML()` before putting it in `innerHTML`, including values inside attributes. After changing it, rebuild `public/widget.js`. If the behaviour also exists in `src/components/widget/ChatWidget.tsx`, keep the two in sync.
- **Styling**: follow `docs/DESIGN.md`. Use the design tokens only (`text-ink`, `text-ink-2`, `bg-surface`, `border-line`, `text-accent`, …): no Tailwind palette colours (`text-gray-500`), no hex values, no `dark:` colour classes, and no `text-[13px]`-style sizes (use `text-2xs`/`xs`/`ui`/`sm`/`md`). Build with the shared components in `src/components/ui/` (`Button`, `Input`/`Field`, `Modal`/`Drawer`, `Tabs`, `Badge`, `Table`, `Toast`, `Tooltip`, `EmptyState`, `LoadingState`/`ErrorState`, `CommandPalette`). Glass (`.glass`, `.popover`) only on the sidebar, modals/popovers and the widget. Every screen needs loading, empty and error states, keyboard access and a 390px layout. `src/lib/design/tokens.test.ts` fails if a token change breaks WCAG AA. Merge conditional classes with `cn()`.
- **Comments**: explain *why*, often in multi-line prose blocks above a function or SQL statement (see `src/lib/supabase/service.ts` and the migrations). Keep that style; don't narrate *what* the code does.
- **Migrations**: `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_snake_description.sql`. Start with a comment block explaining the problem being fixed. Make every migration idempotent (`ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`, `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` before `CREATE POLICY`). `SECURITY DEFINER` functions must `SET search_path = public` and must check `auth.uid()` membership themselves. Never decide privilege from `current_user` inside a definer function, because it is always the owner. Grant `EXECUTE` explicitly and revoke it from `PUBLIC`/`anon` for anything that isn't meant for the widget.
- **AI code**: every model call goes through `chat()` in `src/lib/ai/provider.ts` with a `ProviderConfig` built by `providerConfigFrom(workspace.ai_settings)`, and each caller must have a deterministic fallback for when no provider is configured. Auto-replies must stay idempotent: `reply_to_message_id` plus the unique indexes on `messages`.
- **Teams**: settings screens are `src/components/team/` (`TeamSettings`, `GroupsSettings`), shown in Settings → Team & Availability; server actions are `src/app/actions/team.ts`. Reuse `Modal`, `Field`, `ChipGroup`, `.btn`, `.pill`, `.skeleton`, `Avatar`, and give every screen loading, empty and error states. Collision detection is `src/components/tickets/Presence.tsx`.
- **Tickets**: the UI is `src/components/tickets/` (rendered as the dashboard's `tickets` view) and the server actions are `src/app/actions/tickets.ts`, which guard every call with `assertTicketAccess`. View filters and sorting live in `src/lib/tickets/views.ts`; both the list and the per-view counts use `applyTicketFilters`, so they can't disagree. Run anything a user saved through `normalizeFilters` first. Add a status rule as a trigger plus a case in `ticket-rules.db.test.ts`, not as app code.
- **Channels** (WhatsApp now; built so Instagram/Messenger can follow): one adapter per channel in `src/lib/channels/` (`types.ts` is the contract, `registry.ts` lists adapters, `whatsapp/` is the Cloud API adapter). Inbound: `/api/channels/<channel>/webhook` (platform Meta app, embedded signup) or `/api/channels/<channel>/webhook/<connectionId>` (customer's own app) verifies `X-Hub-Signature-256`, parses, and calls `fn_channel_ingest_inbound`, which creates or updates the visitor, conversation, ticket and message in one transaction and ignores a provider message id it has seen (webhook retries). Outbound: a trigger queues every public agent/bot message on a channel conversation in `channel_outbound_queue`; `processOutboundQueue` (`outbound.ts`) sends it right after the write, on every webhook, and from `/api/cron/channel-outbound`, with backoff decided by `fn_complete_channel_outbound`. The 24-hour WhatsApp window is a trigger (`fn_channel_template_required`): outside it only messages with `metadata.channel_template` are accepted. Credentials are AES-256-GCM encrypted with `CHANNEL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `channel_secrets` (no RLS policy; service role only). Settings UI: `src/components/channels/ChannelsSettings.tsx` (Settings → Omnichannel Chat → Channels); ticket composer pieces: `src/components/tickets/ChannelBits.tsx`. A new channel = an adapter, its registry entry, and the channel lists in `fn_is_ticket_channel` / `fn_channel_has_outbound` / `fn_channel_template_required`. The old WhatsApp fields in `workspace_integrations` are no longer used.
  **Instagram** (`src/lib/channels/instagram/`) is the second adapter, on the Instagram API with Instagram Login (`graph.instagram.com`, professional accounts, no Facebook Page). Connect = Business Login (`/api/channels/oauth/instagram`, state signed by `oauth.ts`) or a pasted token; tokens last 60 days and `refreshDueCredentials` (`refresh.ts`, run by the channel cron) renews them. Webhooks carry only the sender's id, so `getSenderProfile` names the visitor afterwards. Story replies/mentions arrive with `metadata.channel_story`, copied to Cloudinary since story URLs expire. Window rule (`fn_message_channel_guard`, `fn_instagram_reply_window`): 24 hours for everyone; 7 days for a person, sent with the `HUMAN_AGENT` tag, only when the connection's `settings.human_agent` is true (set from `INSTAGRAM_HUMAN_AGENT_ENABLED`, i.e. after App Review). No templates exist, so past the window the ticket composer is disabled with an explanation.
- **Email channel** (`src/lib/channels/email/`, migration `20261015090000_email_channel.sql`, UI `src/components/channels/EmailChannelPanel.tsx`, actions `src/app/actions/email-channel.ts`): the third adapter on the channel framework, behind an `EmailProvider` interface (`types.ts`; `providers/index.ts` is the only place that names a provider, Postmark today). Inbound goes to `/api/channels/email/webhook` → `inbound.ts` (authenticate, parse, route by the address's `+tag`, drop auto-replies/bounces/loops, strip quotes, sanitise HTML, store attachments) → `fn_email_ingest_inbound`, which decides the ticket in SQL: In-Reply-To/References → signed address token → `[#1042]` in the subject only from the requester or someone copied. Never join a ticket on the subject alone. Outbound: the usual queue; `outbound-context.ts` adds the thread, `compose.ts` builds the branded mail (Reply-To is always the signed platform address; From is the customer's own address only once its DKIM is verified). Every mail we send carries `X-Zentry-Mail`; notifications are `Auto-Submitted`. Only conversations whose `channel` is `email` use the adapter; hand-logged email tickets keep the SMTP path (`adapterFor` in `tickets.ts`). Requester notifications are the `notify_requester` trigger action. Add a fixture `.eml` in `fixtures/` and a case to `email.test.ts` / `email.db.test.ts` when you change a rule.
- **Settings** (`src/components/settings/`, registry in `src/lib/settings/registry.ts`): one area with a left nav and search. Every page is a `section:tab` entry in the registry with the capability that may open it (`canOpenTab`), so the nav, the search and the command palette cannot disagree; old ids such as `install` or `domains` still resolve through `resolveTarget`. A page reports unsaved edits with `useReportDirty` (the hub warns before leaving) and uses `SaveBar`, `SettingsCard`, `ComingSoon` from `parts.tsx`. Existing screens are linked in, not copied. Audit log (`workspace_audit_logs`) is written only by database triggers; two-factor is enforced at sign-in by `src/middleware.ts` and the login page.
- **Macros, triggers, automations** (`supabase/migrations/20261014090000_macros_triggers_automations.sql`, UI in `src/components/automation/`, actions in `src/app/actions/automation.ts`): rules are evaluated in the database (`fn_run_ticket_triggers` on ticket and message writes, `fn_run_automations` hourly from `/api/cron/run-automations`), so they hold for every writer. Emails and webhooks are queued in `automation_outbox` and sent by `src/lib/automation/outbox.ts`. `fn_fire_rule` holds the loop guard; add a case to `automation.db.test.ts` when you change a rule behaviour, and keep `src/lib/automation/rules.ts` (inline validation) in step with `fn_validate_conditions` / `fn_validate_actions`. Placeholders live in `fn_render_placeholders`. Don't write `automation_rule_runs` from app code.
- **Bot pipeline** (`generateHelpDeskResponseWithHandover` in `src/lib/ai/anthropic.ts`): every visitor message is first classified by `classifyVisitorIntent` (`src/lib/ai/intent.ts`) into `help_center_question`, `account_specific`, `small_talk`, `out_of_scope` or `wants_human`. Help-center answers come only from published articles, are cited by code (never by the model), and are not attempted when retrieval confidence is low; the bot offers a person instead. If you change a handoff-offer template, keep `HANDOFF_OFFER` matching it (a test checks this), or a visitor's "yes" won't be understood. Add new sample messages to `intent.test.ts` when you change a rule.
- **Errors**: log with a bracketed tag (`console.error('[Auto-Close Error]:', err)`). Don't swallow errors silently in new code. Check `{ error }` on every Supabase call that writes.
- **Git**: commit messages in this repo are not descriptive. Write clear, imperative ones. Don't commit `env.download`, `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` changes or scratch scripts with keys.
